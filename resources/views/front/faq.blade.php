                        <p>In addition to ending your marriage, a divorce addresses all <br> issues within the marriage,
                            including property, finances, and <br> child-related issues. This is the most common way to deal
                            <br> with marital issues, as Florida does not recognize legal <br> separation.</p>

                            and, therefore, do not require the <br> services of an attorney, like writing a business plan,
